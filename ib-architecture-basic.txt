InfiniBand is a dedicated architecture, while RoCE operates over standard Ethernet.

sudo modprobe ib_uverbs






ibstat




For example, on Ubuntu, you would edit /etc/network/interfaces or use netplan if you're using a more recent version






ibping <target_ip>



ib_write_bw

ib_write_bw <source_ip>








RDMA is a method of data transfer that can be implemented over various networks, while InfiniBand is a specific networking architecture that natively supports RDMA.
